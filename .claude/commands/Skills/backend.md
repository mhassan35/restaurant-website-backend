This backend powers the Restaurant Website application.  
It is built with FastAPI and serves structured menu data and static image assets via a REST API.

The backend acts as the single source of truth for all menu items, categories, pricing, ratings, and image URLs, and is designed to be consumed by a Next.js frontend.  
It also handles CORS, static file hosting, and environment-based configuration for local and production deployments.
